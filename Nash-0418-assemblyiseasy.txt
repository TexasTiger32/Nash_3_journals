Elf64 tells the computer how to handle the code based on the operating system

ld combines a number of objects, relocates data and assembls the program

Because chmod was not necessary to compile assembly

Assembly is definitely not "quick and easy" as most people said, and actally
takes a lot of time and effort to do the simplist tasks, such as printing
your name.

"low level" programming is just how close to the actual processor the code
that you are writing is. Assembly is very low level becuase you are
basically just writing directly to the processor and telling it what to do.

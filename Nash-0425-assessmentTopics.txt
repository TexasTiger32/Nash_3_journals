The 10 Concepts I believe will be om the assessment are the following
*Having the proper syntax and knowing what that is 
* Arduino Syntax
* JavaFX the java based  programs
* Java and all of our gaming design criteria

*Slick2D the gaming design based in slick
*Objects and knowing what they are
*Classes and know what they are
*Assembly
knowing the differences and the similarities or that and Java
*Arduino
We worked on that for a good time so its expected to be workable and very well
known
*working through the console 
reason why we didnt really work or talk about it it was expected to already be
known

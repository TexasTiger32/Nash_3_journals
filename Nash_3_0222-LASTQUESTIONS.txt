Yes, for the most part I am ready for the test Friday.
How many Enemies are we making in our edited game?
How exactly are we going to create the traps in the Slick Game?
Is there a minimum amount of levels we need to make?
Look at all the errors that pop up in your code , yes I believe I am prepared
for the task ahead. I do but at the same time I have some questions about some
lines of code that im pretty sure Mr.Davis will explain to where I understand
it.

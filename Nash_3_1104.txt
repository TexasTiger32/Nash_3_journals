A method is  lines of code that you use if you want to do something repeatedly
you can tell it to count to 7 and if you want it to do it more than once
call a method. I used methods in my guessing game my private voids are 
created and called in main to ask the user what their name is and to pick
a  number between 1-10. A while loop is a loop that does something while your
 4-loop is doing something. I used a boolean and counter to set
 a guessing limit, and to answer if the guess was correct, or incorrect. By responding Too low or Too high try again.

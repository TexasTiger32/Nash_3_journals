I know for a fact I messed up on my array I forgot to do a few things to make
it an actual effective array. But besides that im not sure what else i missed.

I could have asked more questions when we were going over it to gain a 
better understanding on the questions asked on the test and put them to use 
and code more when im at home.

I wasnt successful to me but I can and will get better at this and practice 
more so that one day I can consider myself successful

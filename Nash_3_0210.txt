Why does my Orb not shoot in the direction I want it to?
Why does my Orb pnly shoot half the time I play it?
My orb is really big do i just resize it in Gimp?
Why is it that when i put in the codfor my enemy not to just follow but sort 
attack me it is stuck on my player like glue?
Why do my Orbs appear so long after I press the space bar?
whenever my enemy intersect with my player it doesnt take away the same amount
of health I programmed it to take away, why is that?

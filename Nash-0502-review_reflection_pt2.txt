An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of
 a single type.
 
static String[][] myArray = new String[a][b];

int[][] myArray = new int[5][5];
int[][][] myArray = new int[5][5][5];

array[5] = 10;

 while (expression) {
     statement
}
A while loop is helpful when you want to do something while another value or
something is selected. So while it is doing the action it is suppose to do when
that value is selected and while loop is made to do another thing WHILE that
action is in process.

int(value);
String(value);
You put whatever Data Type and then put the respective value and end with a 
semi-colon

So if it was put in caps it would mess up to code  within our Scanner input

Have a method one to create your protagonist and one to give it th values for
speed, direction, etc. Then create a method for health/intersection so that it
takes away health when intersected.

Coordinate values, Health Values, Intersection, Speed, etc

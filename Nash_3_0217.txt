Array's are used to contain an object that holds a fixed number of values
 of a single type.
int[] things = new int[];
String [] names = new String[];
boolean[] truefalse = new boolean[];
double [] numbers = new double[];
int[] number = new int[]; 
number[0] = 42;
String[] names = new String[];
String[0] = "Bob";

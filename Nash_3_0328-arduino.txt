What differences have I noticed in the Arduino variant of languages?
-There is no main class, only a setup class which starts the program.
-Many of the classes that we used did not require a return value, as they could just be using in each different method.
-We did not have to import any packages into the program to get it to work.

What code adaptations did we make?
-Roeder and I took the code for the examples for the buzzer and button, pasted the basic code from each into our
program, and changed the pin locations and names to fit what we were doing, and added more declarations of
buttonPins and buzzerPins to make the piano work.

What is required for a circuit?O

-For a circuit to work, we need some type of connection to the Arduino, and a Power/Ground cabble to power it.

How are programs compiled with Arduino?
-Arduino programs are compiled organizing the code, building the program, and sending the information to the
Arduino so that it can perform the task created in the code.

Describe the projects I have completed this/last week and what I learned from them?
The most impactful projects I have completed in the past week were the button/led project and the buzzer project,
as that is what we used to make our Piano. Using the examples, we were able to understand how the buzzer and
buttons worked, and how we would be able to mesh them together to make them work in sync to create a working
piano, and how we would be able to change the frequency so that it go up the scale one complete octave.

Describe my project and the code adaptations I will have to make.
-The project we have chosen to make is a working piano, with 8 keys, going up an entire octave from C to C,
using one buzzer and 8 buttons. The code adaptations that we had to make were just simple ones that changed the
tone that the buzzer played, and making sure the specific button was LOW so that the buzzer could play the tone
accompanied by the button that was pressed.

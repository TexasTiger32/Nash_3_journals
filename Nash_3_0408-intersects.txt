By looking at the counter set in the code for every time the object intersects
your player it takes away health
if (orb1.hitbox.intersects(i.rect)){
                   i.isvisible = false;  
             }
               if(i.isvisible) {
                  Player.health -= 10000;
                   i.isvisible = false;

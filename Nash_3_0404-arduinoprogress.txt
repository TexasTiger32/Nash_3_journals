We have brainstormed a multitude of ideas and finally we have decided
to do a tic-tac-toe game board.
we have figured everything we need to create the game and the steps
we need to take to accomplish our goal of making a great game.
as of right now we just need to put it together and get this game going
Friday I believe we can turn in a complete game if Wyland shows up a few 
days out of the week.
if it is ust me I can get the game working and have a good game working by 
Friday.
We havent created any Functions yet or made any code changes to our program

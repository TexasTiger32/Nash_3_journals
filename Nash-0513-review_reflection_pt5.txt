I already had knowledge of arrays and how they work and how to work them, 
thanks to the help of Mr.Davis and some friends. Going into the Array Assignment
I  was confident in my ability to work with them I just stumbled across 
some minor problems but with help I figured it out.

How can you make your treasure regenerate but at a different posistion?
What is the easiest way to apply blocked to the array?
How do you use a "Random" correctly?
Whats the proper way to use a "while" loop?
I want my enemies to follow me even when I haven't put in an input for my 
player to move, how would I do that?
These are the only questions I have honestly.

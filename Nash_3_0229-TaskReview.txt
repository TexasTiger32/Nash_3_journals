public class Donut {

}

2.Donut Bismarck = new Donut();
Is this a class constructor?
No, it is instantiating/creating another "Donut" object - it's calling the 
class constructor, with Donut();
3.How do we make a class with values and a class constructor?
Public class Breakfast {
	boolean hasEggs;
	int numOfEggs;
	boolean hasBacon;
	boolean hasOrangeJuice;
	int slicesOfBacon;

	Breakfast(int a, int b, boolean c, boolean d, boolean e) {
		this.numofEggs = a;
		this.slicesOfBacon = b;
		this.hasEggs = c;
		this.hasBacon = d;
		this.hasOrangeJuice = e;
	
	}
	//This getter gets things, i.e., namely in java and oop
	//a getter is usually public so that it can share out private values
	//e.g. a getter for slices of bacon tells the main class how many 
	//slices of bacon

	public int SlicesOfBacon() {
		return this.slicesOfBacon;

}
	//A getter returns the value, by contrast, a setter sets values
	//For Example, to set whether we have orange juice
	
	public void setHasOrangeJuice(boolean a){
		this.hasOrangeJuice = a;
}

$. An array of breakfast
int[] numberz; //this is an array of numbers
char[]; //this is an array of chars
boolean[][] blocked; //this a 2D array of booleans

Breakfast roederesBreakfast = new Breakfast(2,4, true, true, true);
Breakfast[] roedersFamiliesBreakfast =  {roedersBreakfast, papasBreakfast,
mamasBreakfast, sisBreakfast, abuelaBreakfast, abueloBreakfast};
//This is a setter
5.Using getters and setters
roedersBreakfast.setSlicesOfBacon(12);
//This is using a getter
